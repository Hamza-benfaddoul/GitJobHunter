## Discord Webhook Setup (Detailed)

**What is a Discord Webhook?**
A webhook is a URL that allows external applications to send messages to your Discord channel.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Open Discord** (desktop app or web)
2. **Go to your server** where you want job notifications
3. **Right-click on the text channel** you want to use
4. **Select "Edit Channel"** from the menu
5. **Click "Integrations"** in the left sidebar
6. **Click "Webhooks"** 
7. **Click "Create Webhook"** button
8. **Configure the webhook:**
   - Name: "Job Hunter" (or any name you like)
   - Avatar: Optional - upload an image
   - Channel: Should already be selected
9. **Click "Copy Webhook URL"** - this is what you need
10. **Click "Save Changes"**

**Test Your Webhook:**
```bash
curl -X POST "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content":"✅ Job Hunter webhook is working!"}'
```

## Job Sources

The script checks these RSS feeds:
- WeWorkRemotely (all jobs + programming)
- RemoteOK 
- Remotive

*Total: 13 feeds configured in `config.json`*

## Troubleshooting

**Not getting notifications?**
```bash
# Test your webhook
curl -X POST "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"content":"Test"}'
```

**Want to see what's happening?**
```bash
export LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"
python job_finder.py
```

**Check GitHub Actions logs:**
Go to your repo → Actions → latest workflow run
